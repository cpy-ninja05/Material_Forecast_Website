# SPA Routing Fix - "Not Found" Error on Reload

## 🔍 The Problem

When you reload a page or directly access a URL like `https://yoursite.com/projects`, you get a **404 Not Found** error with dark background and white text.

**Why?**
- Your app is a Single Page Application (SPA)
- All routing is handled by React Router on the **client side**
- When you reload `/projects`, the server looks for a file called `projects`
- It doesn't exist → 404 error
- React Router never gets a chance to handle the route

## ✅ The Solution

I've added configuration files that tell the server:
> "For ANY route, serve index.html and let React Router handle it"

## 📁 Files Added

### 1. `public/_redirects` (for Render, Netlify)
```
/* /index.html 200
```
This file is automatically copied to `dist/` during build.

### 2. `public/vercel.json` (for Vercel)
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. `public/netlify.toml` (for Netlify - alternative)
```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

### 4. Updated `vite.config.js`
Added preview configuration for local testing.

## 🚀 How to Deploy the Fix

### For Render (Your Current Setup)

1. **Commit and push these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add frontend/public/_redirects
   git add frontend/public/vercel.json
   git add frontend/public/netlify.toml
   git add frontend/vite.config.js
   git commit -m "fix: Add SPA routing configuration for production"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will automatically:**
   - Detect the changes
   - Rebuild your frontend
   - Include `_redirects` file in the `dist` folder
   - Start serving all routes through `index.html`

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete

4. **Test:**
   - Visit `https://material-forecast-website.onrender.com/projects`
   - Reload the page
   - Should work! ✅

### Verify Deployment

After deployment, check that the `_redirects` file is in your build output:

1. Go to Render dashboard → Your frontend service
2. Click "Shell" (if available) or check build logs
3. Look for: `dist/_redirects` in the build output

## 🧪 Test Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then try:
- `http://localhost:4173/projects`
- Reload the page
- Should work without 404 error

## 📋 What Routes Should Work Now

After deployment, these should all work on reload:

- ✅ `/` - Home/Dashboard
- ✅ `/projects` - Projects page
- ✅ `/teams` - Teams page
- ✅ `/forecasting` - Forecasting page
- ✅ `/materials` - Materials page
- ✅ `/inventory` - Inventory page
- ✅ `/orders` - Orders page
- ✅ `/suppliers` - Suppliers page
- ✅ `/dealers` - Dealers page
- ✅ `/approvals` - Approvals page
- ✅ `/planning-approvals` - Planning approvals
- ✅ `/load-dispatch` - Load dispatch
- ✅ `/operations-maintenance` - Operations maintenance
- ✅ `/purchase-requests` - Purchase requests
- ✅ `/reset-password?token=...` - Password reset

## 🔧 Platform-Specific Notes

### Render
- Uses `_redirects` file ✅
- Automatically copies files from `public/` to `dist/`

### Vercel
- Uses `vercel.json` ✅
- Reads from `public/` folder

### Netlify
- Uses `_redirects` or `netlify.toml` ✅
- Prioritizes `_redirects` if both exist

### GitHub Pages
Requires additional configuration (use Hash Router instead)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
```
User visits: /projects
Server: "I don't have a file called 'projects'"
Result: 404 Not Found (dark screen, white text)
```

### After Fix
```
User visits: /projects
Server: "Serve index.html for all routes"
React loads → React Router sees '/projects' → Shows Projects component
Result: Projects page loads correctly ✅
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?

1. **Check build logs** - Make sure `_redirects` is in `dist/`
   ```
   dist/
     assets/
     index.html
     _redirects  ← Should be here
   ```

2. **Verify file content:**
   ```bash
   cat frontend/public/_redirects
   ```
   Should show: `/* /index.html 200`

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Hard reload: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private mode

4. **Check Render build settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

### 404 on API calls?

If you see 404 on `/api/*` routes:
- This is different - API should go to backend
- Check CORS and API URL configuration

## ✅ Summary

**What was wrong:**
- Server returned 404 for client-side routes

**What's fixed:**
- Added `_redirects` file
- Server now serves `index.html` for all routes
- React Router handles navigation

**What to do:**
1. Commit the new files
2. Push to GitHub
3. Wait for Render to deploy
4. Test by reloading `/projects`

That's it! Your SPA routing should work perfectly now! 🎉
